# mpm-go
Currently WIP. Techincally works, but the "install all products" list is only completed for Linux and Windows at the moment.

UPDATE: Now that MPM allows for all products to be selected, this program could be considered obsolete. However, I would like to continue development for it, as I believe installing all products with this program is easier and allows for activation, something that MPM still doesn't offer. MPM now works properly on macOS, so I'll need to make the full product list for that at some point, as well as adding ARM vs Intel options.
