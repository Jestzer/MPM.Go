# mpm-go
Currently WIP. Techincally works, but the "install all products" list is only completed for Linux at the moment.

There is a known issue with MPM, in general, on Windows with R2023b.

I had some issues with macOS's MPM recently, but I'm not convinced at this moment that I didn't just screw something up.
