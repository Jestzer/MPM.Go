# MPM Wrapper in GO
Currently WIP. Techincally works, but the "install all products" list is only completed for Linux and Windows at the moment.

I need to flesh out support for macOS on ARM and x64 before this can be considered done, which mostly means figuring out what "all" products looks like for each release, which still isn't simple since MathWorks couldn't be bothered to specify this in there MPM-input files.
